Objective:  
This code determines the angle and distance of the marker to the camera center and sends this information to the Arduino. Additional arrow detection is implemented in trial2.py.

Setup:  
Before running, make sure the directories to arrow_template.png and camera_calibration_data.npz are correctly provided in the code.
