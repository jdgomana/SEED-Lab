2. Rotate to locate the beacon, move within 1.5ft of it and stop before hitting it, then rotate 90 degrees in the direction of the arrow.
   
How to operate our demo 2 code:
1. Get onto the raspberry pi powered by the portable charger.
2. Launch test2.py.
3. Load the Arduino code(demo2controls) onto the Arduino. 
4. When ready, turn on 7.5 volt battery pack and the code will start in search mode.
