I had to build a new state machine that transferred the robot from arming to turning to moving forward
and then aligning each of these states having new complexities. I also had to add functionality using to
the wheel angle (theta[i]) and turn it into equations for forward distance and angle turned at the end
these values were multiplied by a straight factor to match my real world measured distances. This
concept later will help me fine tune speed VS accuracy for further demos.

I have two new controllers for turning (kx_phi_turn) and (kx_phi_foward) to help separate and micro
manage both movement patterns separately.

The speed of the robot now based on now much distance left in the forward movement. And computes
if it can stop with (v_stop)

Align phase is final check for how much distance traveled and helps us get ready for next set of
commands

Each wheel has adjustable wgain and voltage cut offs to fine tune wheel differences (our wheel control
however is very similar.)
Instead of driving each wheel separately the body moves together with vl and vR.
