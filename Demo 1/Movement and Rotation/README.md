Controls: A PID controller needs to be implemented in order to control the body of the robot as a whole system instead of a wheel-by-wheel basis. A Functional State machine that takes the robot's initial position, then rotates the robot to the desired heading, then moves forward by a specified distance, and stops and readies itself for the next command.

There is a folder which houses the code ( Demo1AnnotatedCode...) and a .txt that describes the new and additional functionalities from the minilab project (Added Functionalaties.txt)
