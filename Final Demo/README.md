Objective:  

This final demo showcases the full implementation of our robot’s vision-based navigation system using ArUco markers and directional arrows. 
The robot autonomously follows a path of markers by detecting a marker, rotating in the correct direction based on the arrow, moving to the next marker, and repeating until the sequence is complete.
